# The challenge

Land management agencies keep inventories of natural resources, and as part of
this they want to know the forest cover type of their forests.  Generally,
there are two ways of getting this information: via remote sensing, and sending
personnel into the field to manually record the cover type.  However, these
options may be unavailable due to being be prohibitively time consuming,
costly, or legally impossible.  But what if we have cartographic information
available to us, such as elevation, slope, distance to water features, incident
sunlight - can we use this data to predict the cover type?  This is the
question we explore in this challenge.


# The Data

The data comprises observations of 30m x 30m patches in four wilderness ares in
the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado.  Twelve independent
variables were derived using data from the US Geological Survey and US Forest
Services.

* Elevation - Elevation in meters
* Aspect - Aspect in degrees azimuth
* Slope - Slope in degrees
* Horizontal_Distance_To_Hydrology - Horz Dist to nearest surface water features
* Vertical_Distance_To_Hydrology - Vert Dist to nearest surface water features
* Horizontal_Distance_To_Roadways - Horz Dist to nearest roadway
* Hillshade_9am (0 to 255 index) - Hillshade index at 9am, summer solstice
* Hillshade_Noon (0 to 255 index) - Hillshade index at noon, summer solstice
* Hillshade_3pm (0 to 255 index) - Hillshade index at 3pm, summer solstice
* Horizontal_Distance_To_Fire_Points - Horz Dist to nearest wildfire ignition points
* Wilderness_Area (4 binary columns, 0 = absence or 1 = presence) - Wilderness area designation
* Soil_Type (40 binary columns, 0 = absence or 1 = presence) - Soil Type designation

We want to predict the cover type:

* Cover_Type (7 types, integers 1 to 7) - Forest Cover Type designation
1 - Spruce/Fir
2 - Lodgepole Pine
3 - Ponderosa Pine
4 - Cottonwood/Willow
5 - Aspen
6 - Douglas-fir
7 - Krummholz


# Additional Information

The four wilderness areas are

* Rawah (area 1)
* Neota (area 2)
* Comanche Peak (area 3) 
* Cache la Poudre (area 4) 

"Neota (area 2) probably has the highest mean elevational value of the 4
wilderness areas.  Rawah (area 1) and Comanche Peak (area 3) would have a lower
mean elevational value, while Cache la Poudre (area 4) would have the lowest
mean elevational value." (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Covertype)

"As for primary major tree species in these areas, Neota would have spruce/fir
(type 1), while Rawah and Comanche Peak would probably have lodgepole pine
(type 2) as their primary species, followed by spruce/fir and aspen (type 5).
Cache la Poudre would tend to have Ponderosa pine (type 3), Douglas-fir (type
6), and cottonwood/willow (type 4). 

The Rawah and Comanche Peak areas would tend to be more typical of the overall
dataset than either the Neota or Cache la Poudre, due to their assortment of
tree species and range of predictive variable values (elevation, etc.) Cache la
Poudre would probably be more unique than the others, due to its relatively low
elevation range and species composition."
